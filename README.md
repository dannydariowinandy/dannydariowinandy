# 👋 Hi, I'm Danny Dario Winandy

🎯 **IT Director | Scaling IT Operations and Cybersecurity | Building Resilient, Cloud-First and Compliant Enterprises**  
🎤 **Public Speaker | Thought Leader | Cross-Industry Change Maker**

---

With nearly two decades of leadership experience, I’ve guided enterprise IT and Operations organizations through large-scale transformation, modernization, and innovation. My experience spans FinTech, FMCG, Telecom, and Consulting, where I’ve built high-performing teams, driven digital change, and aligned complex technologies with long-term business value.

I view IT as a strategic growth catalyst, not a cost center. My focus is on architecting secure, scalable, and intelligent infrastructures that enable agility, resilience, and sustainable impact across the enterprise.
